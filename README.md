The front end for our 2023 Software Engineering project

To get started, run `npm install` in the top-level directory.

Remember, `node_modules` is a joke for a reason; expect that to take 400+ MBs for a final
package that's like 800kB.

To dynamically view changes as you make them, run `npm start`. This will launch your browser
and monitor changes made to files to automatically refresh and update. If you have two monitors,
nows the time to use them!

If you need to change the browser, you can use `BROWSER=firefox npm start`. Just replace the 
`firefox` with whatever browser executable it is that you want. (I couldn't get this
working, but that's what the documentation says...)
